<p>I think my queerness will embrace my femininity.</p>

<p>We kind of fight them with our bodies, like the the p&auml;pstin, like the women in the movies fighting the guys with their tits. One does it literally, the other does it in camouflage. Blending in vs. Combat. The prof. Term for the disciplin (beyonce) is entertainer. And a good entertainer always educates. Be it with information or noval technology. Even nostaltic music teaches us, just not about now, but history.</p>

<p>I remember when i complained i never had barbies just to trick my mother to buy one for me. It was a vet barbie and the actual reason i wanted it was there was a pet robotic golden retriever that came with it. Ive just watched the barbie movie to fond visual insporation and as i googled the castle robotic pets came across my search. There is zoomies, marscat and luna, the dog. It is truly unbelieveable. If yoi thought kirbys were spooky aait till you see this pup wag its tail and bark at his sleepy friend. Somehow sooner or later humans find themselves with the same questions they did ages ago. We want to recreate everything all of the time.</p>

<p>I have RIP/<br>
I have TRAPPED/</p>

<p>SO ONE IS MISSING<br>
we are either TRAPPED<br>
or RIPPED (shred, killed)<br>
or ENLIGHTENED (WOKE)</p>

<p>The ENLIGHTENED (MEDICINE MAN, THE ILL, THE SURVIVOR) THE ANARCHIST(No, the ANARCHIST is one who RIPs)</p>

<p>Is a ROOMBA sort of a BLACK HOLE of LIFE?</p>

<p>TRAPPED is another manifesto about the human condition, social norms, Xenomorphs, Parasites and mind altering substances and myths about aliens, ghosts and their translation into CYBERSPACE/ Trap is a music form which consists of very short hi hat hits that look like a &quot;trapping&quot; fence in a DAW, the contemporary form of hiphop, called cloudrap.</p>

<p>Beautiful de(con)struction<br>
The decay of objects/entropy vs digital works</p>

<p>There was something about real life i always found irritating; the constant dust, that was settling everywhere. Since my early childhood i was allergic to everything. I wondered, what would a world without dust, without the constant potential for chaos look like. Ive had once written a love poem about my laptop. To me, a child that was always on the move and had little personal things, digital technology was a place of comfort and ironically, privacy. A place i could always get back to, to kill some time, to find or totally lose myself. Before that i had been limited to singled records or books. Here ive had everything all at once.</p>

<p>The way ive used to use the internet and the way it presented itself was different than today. Everything seems more fragmented. As if it went thru its own kind of tides and waves in which particles had left its original place and patched to something completely out of its context. At the same time the visual had made the opposite evolution. Sites are now seamless and animated, the resolutions are crystal clear. So again, like in the real world, earlier, i find myself irritated. This time not from the dust, but from the absence of it.</p>

<p>My personal development made an evolution of its own. I have slowly learned that a majority of life qas about upkeep and maintenance and that the tranquility such tasks bring are a much needed space for inner reflection. So dust and dust management became something ive slowly learned to understand. At the same time, ive had to think about my early thoughts and about one part inside of me that loves to let things rot, decay or break.</p>

<p>I have not yet understood what my primal sentiment lies in this topic.</p>

<p>IS IT REALLY DECONSTRUCTION?</p>

<p>things that come to mind: derrida-antioedipus/destroying a guitar/ripped jeans/Trans:ripping the penis open/ Code:Reprogramming/AI</p>

<p>IS RIP a REVOLUTION<br>
IS REVOLUTION a REBIRTH<br>
ARE THINGS ACTUALLY CHANGING or ARE WE TRAPPED IN A LOOP OF THE HUMAN CONDITION</p>

<p>(I would love to call this the RIP-movement)<br>
RIP is the fascination for decay and the non-judgemental execution of non-violent sabotage and rupture.</p>

<p>Topics:SAMPLING/RESOURCES/WASTE/ENTROPY/</p>

<p>The project is/the product is/the fruit of labour is/the goal of achievement is: how is text and aestetic/visual and audio transformable into an intertwined medial presence that informs with perusasion? How is the platform of POP useful as a stage for intellectual discourse or if its not how can it become it?</p>

<p>I think scorpio rising would be really cool if it weren't worldly. Like it's ancient ideas about scorpions, poison, very worldly and earthbased. That's why in TUXEDO MOON it's imprtant to have the opppsite, because it lives in a fantasy world, parts need to be based in reality. Because it is about bodily sensuality and intimacy in baseline and fantasy and the fight against our own obstacle in imagination. In scorpio rising the content is grounded so it needs to spaced out. Also i feel ugly in saying this, but it needs to be said. Being strong against another is ugly. You become a predator. You want to eat the other alive who pushes you to the corner. So the other is really you at that point.</p>

<p>What do i have for fine arts?<br>
The masks, the nunchucks, the texts, the music. The cover. The websites? The ideas for the videos.</p>

<p>So the work is this one piece of multiple pieces, an album with songs, videos to each song, costume/dramaturgy/aestetic to each video and the products/forms of distributions. How does an unestablished artist promote oneself in a thoughtful way and how can each step carry meaning?<br>
How can a product elevate itself over the thing/product that it is and become a practice and is it important/useful/of intrinsic value?</p>

<p>Wouldnt it be cooler to work with the supports of a 3d printer, go back into designing and repeat? It's cool thaz a machine calculates the supports 4 you</p>

<p>Like with AI<br>
Statics should be no problem anymore<br>
Am i wrong<br>
Designs however<br>
Idk its just fun 2 do. I mean it does help designing it. Would be cool to come up with stuff lile that.</p>

<p>Most of the time i spend in hiding/sensei<br>

When i'm queen i want to teach dignity<br>
When i am queen i want to train you to protect yoirself and live a full life</p>

<p>We all carry divinity inside of us<br>
There is a way in meeting each other inside this//temporary//space</p>

<p>We manifested in a form where we can communicate with each other. Something made us oddly same, but not as same as when we would have shared one mind. The interactions can produce a multitude of things, signals, objects, machines.</p>

<p>We have learned so well how we communicate that we can create things that communicate by themselves.</p>

<p>Now we have to learn how we can use this example to amplify our understanding about each other. These mechanisms embedded in devices are fluid so that everyone socialized by those pick up the mechanisms by default. This should show us what would be worth cultivating and what has reached its end.</p>

<p>What if this was an audiovisual research project</p>

<p>What are outside of sex/outside of desire<br>
Is this world a laboratory?</p>

<p>Do we belong to each other<br>
Or is our contact based in temporality</p>

<p>What are the contracts of humans, other than shame and how can we overcome it together</p>

<p>It's again unfulfilled love story o'clock at mewville so let's write a song</p>

<p>For a second there<br>
&quot; &quot; &quot;<br>
Time had meaning<br>
As it passed i forget<br>
For a second there<br>
I felt the ground<br>
Again<br>
For a second there i thought i was fine<br>
i believed that i had all i needed. I was all<br>
I needed</p>

<p>((I want a device which i can load my samples in and play them without the computer. I also want the parameters 2 be adjustable. Id also lile to be able to program my own synths in a program (and beats and other) and be able to play it all on the same device without a computer and that should totally be possible if we have phones. Just not super easy 2 program. So i can keep 1 device and 1 system 4 ever.</p>

<p>For a second it was all okay<br>
But i'm in trouble now<br>
Once again</p>

<p>No matter what i hear<br>
It will not tame my heart<br>
I have poison<br>
And ill cut (my skin)a star to suck it out<br>
You viper<br>
You baby<br>
Looking at u <br>
And i get all crazy</p>

<p>I cannot<br>
Think<br>
I cannot<br>
Feel<br>
I needed time<br>
To heal<br>
one glimpse <br>
I skip<br>
A beat<br>
The next<br>
I don't know how to stop<br>
I don't know how to stop now<br>
I don't know how to stop thinking bout you ever again.</p>

<p>I cannot stop thinking of you again</p>

<p>And even the horses had wings</p>
